If it is true, then effects other than what the initial research paper suggests also may be true. Another thing that may also be true is that we can capitalize harder on index rebalancing if it is announced over the weekend. We can create a strategy for that and backtest it.\n",

    "If a signal is 3x as strong on a particular security than another, should we weight 3x as much? Not neccessarily. It wouldn't make sense in most cases actually, like sentiment. If positive sentiment is 3x stronger on Tesla vs Nvidia, we should probably weight Tesla more, but not 3x as much. That wouldn't make sense. \n",
